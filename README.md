# Bitreserve SDK for PHP

Bitreserve is a next generation money service business that shields you from bitcoin volatility by enabling you to hold bitcoin as the money you use every day.

The Bitreserve SDK for PHP provides an easy way for developers to integrate PHP applications with the [Bitreserve API](https://developers.bitreserve.org).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.4.4 with the [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension.
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library.

## Installation

### Standalone

Grab the latest version of the library:

    $ git clone https://github.com/seegno/bitreserve-sdk-php.git

Install composer:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install the library dependencies:

    $ php composer.phar install

Require the autoloader file generated by composer:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Integrating with another project using composer

Require the library package as a dependency:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "seegno/bitreserve-sdk-php": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

## Basic usage:

First, contact Bitreserve support (..email with prepopulated subject..) to receive a Personal Access Token (PAT). A PAT establishes who you are, and what permissions you have when interacting with the API. Read more about authentication on the [developer website](https://developer.bitreserve.org/api/v0/#authentication).

Secondly, create a new instance of the `Client` class with token. Take a look at the following examples and explore more on the [examples](https://github.com/bitreserve/bitreserve-sdk-php/example) directory.

### Get authenticated user
```
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use \Bitreserve\BitreserveClient as Client;

// Initialize the client.
$client = new Client('AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN');

// Get the current user.
$user = $client->getToken()->getUser();
```

### Create and commit a new transaction
```
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use \Bitreserve\BitreserveClient as Client;

// Initialize the client.
$client = new Client('AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN');

// Get the current user.
$user = $client->getToken()->getUser();

// Get a specific card by id.
$card = $user->getCardsById('ade869d8-7913-4f67-bb4d-72719f0a2be0');

// Create a new transaction.
$transaction = $card->createTransaction('foo@bar.com', '2.0', 'BTC');

// Commit the transaction.
$transaction->commit();
```
